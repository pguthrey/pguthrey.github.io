Another hobby of mine is dog training.  My pup Raven seems to be a black lab+border collie+terrier mix, and she is a quick learner!  She has the following titles 

* AKC Canine Good Citizen 
* AKC Novice Tricks Dog

And is working on the following:

* AKC Intermediate Tricks Dog (9/10)
* AKC Advanced Tricks Dog (1/10)
* AKC Performer Dog (1/10)
