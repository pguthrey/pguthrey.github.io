## Method of Lines Transpose Scalable Software Package (MOLTN)

MOLTN is a codebase for the Method of Lines Transpose built entirely from the [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos) API, with built-in MPI abstractions.
The goals of this codebase is a framework that is:

* a standarized codebase for the Method of Lines Transpose
* efficient for all archiectures: GPU, CPU, and FPGA
* accessible to users seeking to learn about high performance computing codes
* accessible to users seeking fast solutions to various applications without digging too deep into code 

The codebase will be open to the public soon: [MOLTN on GitHub](https://github.com/pguthrey/MOLTN)
