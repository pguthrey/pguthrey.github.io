## Board Games

I am a board game enthusiast, and I run a modest developer's club for community folks trying to turn game ideas into working prototypes. 

My current project is **Centuries**, an engine-builder game where players complete projects to gain victory points and permanent benefits, all while managing their resources which include time. If you are interesting in becoming an alpha tester for Centuries, please email me!
