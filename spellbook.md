## The Applied Math Spellbook

This is a former project of mine where I was compiling my notes from various classes, notable textbooks, and independent explorations. I never polished the notes into a textbook, but that might be an interesting project if I ever have the opportunity. Please feel free to email me any mistakes you notice or comments you have about this compendium.
