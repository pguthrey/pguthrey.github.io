### Research Projects
discontinuous galerkin methods, ultra high order methods, hyperbolic conservation laws, high performance computing, GPU computing, shock hydrodynamics, limiters, imex, magnetohydrodynamics, plasmas, relativistic plasmas, computational science, numerical analysis,  machine learning

*  [RIDG](./ridg): The Regionally Implicit Discontinious Galerkin method, a high-order explicit method able to take very large (CFL of order 1) time-steps while maintaining nearest neighbor stenciling
*  [shock hydro](./shocks): There are numerous approaches to limiting spurious oscillations, but extending these to space-time formulations is an open challenge
*  [kinetics](./kinetics): Relativistic plasmas 

### Computational Projects

*  [DoGPack](http://www.dogpack-code.org/): I am a current developer for James Rossmanith's discontinuous Galerkin software package. 
*  [MOLTN](./moltn):  I am the lead developer for a fully Kokkos computational codebase built around the Method of Lines Transpose.  

### Personal Projects

*  [The Applied Math Spellbook](./spellbook): Typed notes from my time in graduate school
*  [Board Games](./boardgames): Board Game design
*  [Dog Training](./dogtraining): AKC tricks dog training
