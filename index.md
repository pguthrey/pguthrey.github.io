## Pierson T. Guthrey

I am currently a postdoc with the [Center for Computational Math Science and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) working with [Andrew Christlieb](https://cmse.msu.edu/directory/faculty/andrew-christlieb/).

I received my Ph.D. from [Iowa State University](https://math.iastate.edu/) under the advisement of [James Rossmanith](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/rossmani/).

Feel free to download my CV <a href="/Guthrey_cv.pdf" download="Guthrey_cv.pdf">here</a>.

### My keywords

discontinuous galerkin methods, ultra high order methods, hyperbolic conservation laws, high performance computing, GPU computing, shock hydrodynamics, limiters, imex, magnetohydrodynamics, plasmas, relativistic plasmas, computational science, numerical analysis,  machine learning

### Research Projects

*  [RIDG](./ridg): The Regionally Implicit Discontinious Galerkin method, a high-order explicit method able to take very large (CFL of order 1) time-steps while maintaining nearest neighbor stenciling
*  [shock hydro](./shocks): There are numerous approaches to limiting spurious oscillations, but extending these to space-time formulations is an open challenge I seek to solve
*  [kinetics](./kinetics): Relativistic plasma models offer rich new computational challenges that require innovative techniques

### Computational Projects

*  [DoGPack](http://www.dogpack-code.org/): I am a current developer for James Rossmanith's discontinuous Galerkin software package. 
*  [MOLTN](./moltn):  I am the lead developer for a fully Kokkos computational codebase built around the Method of Lines Transpose.  

### Personal Projects

*  [The Applied Math Spellbook](./spellbook): Typed notes from my time in graduate school
*  [Board Games](./boardgames): Board Game design
*  [Dog Training](./dogtraining): AKC tricks dog training
